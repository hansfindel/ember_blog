EmberBlog - Los Blogos
==========

Learning to build an ember application

This blog is built from the following open source components:

- [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) - The back end API is a Rails app. It responds to requests (almost RESTfully) in JSON.
- [EmberRails](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails) - The front end is an Ember.js app that communicates with the Rails API. 
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) - The UI is designed and accomplished with Zurb Foundation.
