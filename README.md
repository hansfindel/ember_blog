EmberBlog - Los Blogos
==========

Learning to build an ember application

This blog is built from the following open source components:

- [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) - The back end API is a Rails app. It responds to requests (almost RESTfully) with JSON.
- [EmberRails](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails) - The front end is an Ember.js app that communicates with the Rails API. 
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) - The UI is designed and accomplished with Zurb Foundation. It has a similar structure with bootstrap, so I decided to test it as well. 

## Learning Ember.js

There are a few tutorials to learn to use this framework. But many of those use other tools to accomplish some of the frameworks functionalities. The "official tutorial" linked in the page is a outdated and some of its lessons doesn't apply anymore.
