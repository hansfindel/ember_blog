EmberBlog - Los Blogos
==========

Learning to build an ember application

This blog is built from the following open source components:

- [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) - Our back end API is a Rails app. It responds to requests (RESTfully <not yet...but hopefully soon> and responds) in JSON.
- [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) - Our front end is an Ember.js app that communicates with the Rails API.
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) - This allows as to easily put some "pretty" design to the UI
